The Knight Fight videogame was my final project for my CS1 course (CS164). The game is a 2D action RPG, allowing you to take your army of select knights and set of fortunes into battles of enemies. 

The game takes in two csv files gamedata.csv and knights.csv. These files upload all of the usable fortunes, playable knights, and mob types in the game.
